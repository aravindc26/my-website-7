## What is Velu AI?

Velu AI is an autonomous documentation assistant built to keep product knowledge accurate, current, and easy to ship. It connects to the systems product teams already rely on—such as Slack, Linear, Jira, GitHub, Confluence, Notion, Zendesk, and Google Drive—and continuously transforms conversations, tickets, release notes, and rich media into structured documentation. By monitoring product changes and knowledge signals in real time, Velu AI drafts, updates, and governs technical docs, onboarding guides, changelogs, and help center content with minimal manual effort. The platform emphasizes safe automation through diff-based review workflows, hallucination scoring, and role-based approvals so teams can trust every change it proposes.

## Why it matters

Growing SaaS organizations struggle to keep documentation aligned with fast product delivery. Stale docs confuse developers, slow onboarding, and increase support volume. Velu AI reduces content staleness, cuts manual writing workload by targeting 70% automation, and shortens the lag between a feature release and its documentation update to less than 24 hours. The result is a continuously maintained knowledge base that improves help center coverage, accelerates user activation, and gives product leaders confidence that customer-facing content reflects the latest release.

## Who is Velu AI for?

Velu AI is designed for the cross-functional teams responsible for building, documenting, and supporting modern software products:

- **Technical writers** who need a central, context-rich assistant to synthesize scattered updates while enforcing voice, tone, and style rules.
- **Product managers** who want assurance that roadmap changes, specs, and launch details are reflected in customer-facing documentation without manual coordination.
- **Developers** who rely on up-to-date API references and onboarding workflows that evolve alongside code commits and release branches.
- **Support and success teams** who must keep FAQs and troubleshooting guides aligned with the latest customer questions to deflect tickets faster.
- **Founders and lean SaaS teams** who lack dedicated documentation staff yet need professional, evergreen product guides from day one.

By serving these personas through automated ingestion, drafting, and publishing workflows, Velu AI becomes the documentation brain of an organization—ensuring every feature, customer insight, and support interaction feeds back into trustworthy, discoverable documentation.
